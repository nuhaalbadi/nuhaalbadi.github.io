<p>I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mishras/" target="_blank">Shivakant Mishra</a>.</p>


</p>My research interests are in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and Arabic Nautral Language Processing.</p>

</p>My PhD research involves detecting and characterizing misbehaviors online, specifically on Arabic social media. Problems I have studied include religious hate speech and malicious bots.</p>

</p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Taibah University, Saudi Arabia in 2012. In 2017, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from University of Colorado Boulder.</p>
